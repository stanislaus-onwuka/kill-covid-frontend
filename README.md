### Kill Coveed

Kill-Coveed is a remote health guide that helps patients (who can be classified as patients with mild symptoms of the Covid19 infection) in their self-isolation routine.<br/><br/>

**Who can use Coveed**<br/>
✅ Tested patients (with minimal symptoms) who wish to self isolate<br/>

✅ People who suspect that they have been infected, and are experiencing mild symptoms<br/><br/>

**How it Works**<br/>
✅ A user signs up and he gets to add his/her symptoms on a daily basis to the app, and the app records that data over the space of two weeks.<br/>
✅ The data is then sent to a review staging area,where a certified medical practioner (MP) can review the progress of the patient based on his/her medical history. The MP can     recommend that the patient stays on the app for an extra two weeks in isolation or schedule a test for the patient , and can as well flag a patient for emergency.<br/>

✅ While a patient is on the app the patient can willingly contact emergency, and will consent to having his location revealed to health agencies, and be picked up to a proper isolation center if he observes that he's unstable.<br/>

**Benefits of Kill Coveed**<br/>
✅ It eases the tension on the medical system , since lots of cases can be addressed remotely<br/>

✅ It lowers the chances of  front-liners in this war against Covid19 - getting infected <br/>

✅ More cases can be brought under the radar, lots of people here in Nigeria , are either afraid to go for tests or ignorant, with this we can keep an eye on them.<br/>
